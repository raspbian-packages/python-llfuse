   * Don't send SIGHUP if exception is encountered in destroy()
     handler (since at that point, main loop has already terminated
     and signal handling been reset).

   * Fix a problem with request handler exceptions being re-raised
     not only in llfuse.main(), but also in llfuse.close() when
     running single threaded.

   * Explicitly initialize Python thread support. Previously, calling
     llfuse.main() resulted in a crash if no Python threads were used
     before the call.

   * Removed handle_exc() method. If request handle raise an exception,
     the main loop now terminates and the exception is re-raised and
     passed to the caller of llfuse.main().
   
   * llfuse.close() can now leave the mountpoint in an inaccessible
     state to signal a shutdown due to an internal file system
     error.

   * The destroy() request handler is now called without the
     global lock acquired. This makes sense, because it's not called
     as part of the main loop but by llfuse.close().
