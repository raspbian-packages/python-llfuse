Description: ..
          NOTE: We cannot use sophisticated ReST syntax (like
          e.g. :file:`foo`) here because this isn't rendered correctly
          by PyPi and/or BitBucket.
        
        The Python-LLFUSE Module
        ========================
        
        .. start-intro
        
        Python-LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE_
        API. It requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and
        3.x. Like FUSE itself, Python-LLFUSE is developed for Linux
        systems. However, we try to maintain compatibility with OS-X, FreeBSD
        and NetBSD as well (but due to lack of pre-release testers we can't
        guarantee that every Python-LLFUSE release will run on these
        platforms - please report any bugs and we will try to fix them).
        
        Python-LLFUSE releases can be downloaded from PyPi_. The documentation
        can be `read online`__ and is also included in the ``doc/html``
        directory of the Python-LLFUSE tarball.
        
        
        Getting Help
        ------------
        
        Please report any bugs on the `issue tracker`_. For discussion and
        questions, please use the general `FUSE mailing list`_. A searchable
        `mailing list archive`_ is kindly provided by Gmane_.
        
        
        Development Status
        ------------------
        
        The Python-LLFUSE API is not yet stable and may change from one
        release to the other. Starting with version 0.42, Python-LLFUSE uses
        semantic versioning. This means changes in the API will be reflected
        in an increase of the major version number, i.e. the next
        backwards-incompatible version will be 1.0. Projects designed for
        e.g. version 0.42.1 of Python-LLFUSE are thus recommended to declare a
        dependency on ``llfuse >= 0.42.1, < 1.0``.
