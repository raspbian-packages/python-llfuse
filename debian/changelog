python-llfuse (0.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First official debian release. Closes: 626658
  * Breaks and Replaces s3ql <= 0.28, this package isn't in the official
    debian package but was provided by upstream over various channels (LLFUSE
    was factored out of S3QL in version 0.29).
  * Rebuilding of HTML documentation requires (yet unreleased) Sphinx version
    1.1 or resolution of wishlist bug #63040, therefore we do not rebuild the
    documentation in debian/rules but use the HTML files included in the
    upstream tarball.
