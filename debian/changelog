    python-llfuse-doc package.

python-llfuse (0.36-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Depend on Cython > 0.15.1, previous versions generated segfaulting
    code.
  * Breaks S3QL < 1.2, API changed in non-backwards compatible way.
    (python-llfuse is not in any stable release, and S3QL is the
    only reverse dependency, so a new package name does not seem
    justified).
  * Update format of copyright file.
  * Fixed argument parsing under Python 3.x
  * Do correct typecasting of mode_t constants. Fix introduces
    build dependency on Cython 0.15 (Closes: #635196).
  * Use underscore.js from libjs-underscore rather than shipping
    our own version.
  * Added correct copyright information for files in doc/html/_static.
  * Thanks to Jakub Wilk for his packaging review.

python-llfuse (0.33-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build extension before generating documentation, so that
    autogenerated documentation is no longer empty. Closes: 631871
  * Ship cached python intersphinx file in debian/, so that it
    does not need to be downloaded at build time.

python-llfuse (0.32-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Created separate -doc package for documentation. Closes: 630632
  * Regenerate documentation in debian/rules. Closes: 630605

 -- Nikolaus Rath <Nikolaus@rath.org>  Sat, 25 Jun 2011 13:01:03 -0400

python-llfuse (0.32-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * First official debian release. Closes: 626658
  * Breaks and Replaces s3ql <= 0.28, this package isn't in the official
    debian package but was provided by upstream over various channels (LLFUSE
    was factored out of S3QL in version 0.29).
  * Rebuilding of HTML documentation requires (yet unreleased) Sphinx version
    1.1 or resolution of wishlist bug #63040, therefore we do not rebuild the
    documentation in debian/rules but use the HTML files included in the
    upstream tarball.
