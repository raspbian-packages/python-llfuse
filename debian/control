Description: Python bindings for the low-level FUSE API
 Python-llfuse is a set of Python bindings for the low level
 FUSE API. Bindings for the high level API are provided
 by the python-fuse package.
 .
 FUSE (Filesystem in USErspace) is a simple interface for userspace
 programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. FUSE
 also aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to
 create and mount their own filesystem implementations.
