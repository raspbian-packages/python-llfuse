Subject: Work around bug in mips+mipsel libc

Forwarded: no
Patch-Name: mips_dev_t.diff

On mips and mipsel, the st_dev and st_rdev members of struct stat do not
have type dev_t. This breaks POSIX compatibility, but is difficult to fix
(cf. https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17786).

To work around the issue, we change the definition of struct stat that
is used by Cython when we are compiling under mips. Note that this
requires the Cython compilation to run under mips, and that the
resulting C file will be mips specific (without the patch, the
generated C file is suitable for any architecture).

Upstream is not interested in this change for obvious reasons.
