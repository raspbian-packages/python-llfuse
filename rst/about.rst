About LLFUSE
============

LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE_ API. It
requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and 3.x.

LLFUSE was originally part of S3QL_, but has been factored out so
that it can be used by other projects as well.

To download LLFUSE, please visit the `LLFUSE homepage`_. The
documentation can be `read online`__ and is also included in the
:file:`doc/html` directory of the LLFUSE tarball.

Please report any bugs on the `issue tracker`_. For discussion and
questions, please use the general `FUSE mailing list`_. A searchable
`mailing list archive`_ is kindly provided by Gmane_.
