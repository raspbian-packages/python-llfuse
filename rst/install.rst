Dependencies
============

In order to build and run Python-LLFUSE you need the following software:

* Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD or MacOS X system
* Python_ 2.6 or newer (including Python 3.x), installed with
  development headers
* The `setuptools`_ Python module, version 1.0 or newer.
* When running under Python 2.x, the `contextlib2`_ Python module from
  PyPi.
* the `pkg-config`_ tool
* the `attr`_ library
* A C compiler (only for building)

To run the unit tests, you will need

* The `py.test`_ module, version 3.3.0 or newer

When using Linux, you also need:

* Kernel 2.6.9 or newer. Starting with kernel
  2.6.26 you will get significantly better write performance, so under
  Linux you should actually use *2.6.26 or newer whenever possible*.
* Version 2.9.0 or newer of the FUSE_ library, including development
  headers (typically distributions provide them in a *libfuse-devel*
  or *libfuse-dev* package).

In case of FreeBSD and NetBSD you will need:

* The FUSE4BSD_ kernel module.

For OS-X, you need:

* the OSXFUSE_ package.


Stable releases
===============

To install a stable Python-LLFUSE release:

1. Download and unpack the release tarball from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/llfuse/
2. Run ``python setup.py build_ext --inplace`` to build the C extension
3. Run ``python -m pytest test/`` to run a self-test. If this fails, ask
   for help on the `FUSE mailing list`_  or report a bug in the
   `issue tracker <https://github.com/python-llfuse/python-llfuse/issues>`_.
4. To install system-wide for all users, run ``sudo python setup.py
   install``. To install into :file:`~/.local`, run ``python
   setup.py install --user``.


Development Version
===================

If you have checked out the unstable development version from the
repository, a bit more effort is required. You need to also have
Cython_ (0.29.21 or newer) and Sphinx_ (1.1 or newer) installed, and the
necessary commands are::

  python setup.py build_cython
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
  python -m pytest test/
  python setup.py build_sphinx
  python setup.py install
