===================
 Installing LLFUSE
===================

.. highlight:: sh

Stable releases
===============

LLFUSE can be installed like any other Python extension. Make sure
that you have the Python, FUSE and extended attribute ("xattr")
development headers installed, then download and extract the LLFUSE
tarball and run ::

  sudo python setup.py install

or :: 

  python setup.py install --user

Note that LLFUSE requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and Python 2.6.

Development Version
===================

If you have checked out the unstable development version from the
Mercurial repository, a bit more effort is required. You need to have
recent versions of Cython_ and Sphinx_ installed, and the necessary
commands are::

  python setup.py build_cython
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace
  python setup.py build_sphinx
  python setup.py install
  
  
.. _Cython: http://www.cython.org/
.. _Sphinx: http://sphinx.pocoo.org/
