          NOTE: We cannot use sophisticated ReST syntax (like
          e.g. :file:`foo`) here because this isn't rendered correctly
          by PyPi.
        
        The Python-LLFUSE Module
        ========================

        **Warning - no longer maintained**
        
        Python-LLFUSE is no longer actively maintained. Unless you are stuck
        with Python 2.x or libfuse 2.x, we recommended to use the pyfuse3_
        module instead.
        
        Python-LLFUSE is a set of Python bindings for the low level FUSE_
        API. It requires at least FUSE 2.8.0 and supports both Python 2.x and
        3.x. Like FUSE itself, Python-LLFUSE is developed for Linux systems,
        but it should be compatible with OS-X, FreeBSD and NetBSD as well.
        
        Python-LLFUSE releases can be downloaded from PyPi_. The documentation
        can be `read online`__ and is also included in the ``doc/html``
        directory of the Python-LLFUSE tarball.
