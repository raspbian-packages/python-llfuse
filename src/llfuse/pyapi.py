    self-explanatory.

    The access, modification and creation times may be specified
    either in nanoseconds (via the *st_Xtime_ns* attributes) or in
    seconds (via the *st_Xtime* attributes). When times are specified
    both in seconds and nanoseconds, the nanosecond representation
    takes precedence. If times are represented in seconds, floating
    point numbers may be used to achieve sub-second
    resolution. Nanosecond time stamps must be integers. Note that
    using integer nanoseconds is more accurately than using float
    seconds.

    `EntryAttributes` directly as long as they provide the required

    by the FUSE kernel module without calling the handler again.

    It is recommended that file systems are derived from this class
    and only overwrite the handlers that they actually implement. (The
    default implementations defined in this class all just raise the
    not-implemented exception).

    The only exception that request handlers are allowed to raise is
    `FUSEError`. This will cause the specified errno to be
    returned by the syscall that is being handled.

    Note that all character data (directory entry names, extended
    attribute names and values, symbolic link targets etc) are passed
    as `bytes` and must be returned as `bytes`. This applies to both
    running under Python 2.x and 3.x
